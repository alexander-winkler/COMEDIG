# Online Presentation for TEI-editions of Venetian opera libretti

- The folder `xml` contains the TEI-encoded XML files of the libretti.
- The subdirectories in `imgs` hold the scans of the libretti.


The online presentation is very basic and still under construction.

# TODO

- add image files
- optimize presentation of parallel text (currently texts aren't well aligned)
