# Online Presentation for TEI-editions of Venetian opera libretti

- The folder `xml` contains the TEI-encoded XML files of the libretti.
- The subdirectories in `imgs` hold the scans of the libretti.


The online presentation is very basic and still under construction.

# TODO

- the Viewer is still far from perfect. The Ceteicean framework has either to be adapted to the needs of the project or – maybe better – another framework has to be used (vercelli viewer?)
- add contact form to facitate interaction with research community
- add downloadable text-pdfs
